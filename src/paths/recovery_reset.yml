  summary: Resets the user's password using the recovery challenge token and new password.
  description: >
    This route allows the user to reset their password by submitting the new password
    along with the signed token received during the recovery challenge step. The token 
    must be submitted within the specified expiration time. The server will validate 
    the token and the new password before resetting it. If the token is invalid, expired, 
    or incorrect, an appropriate error message will be returned.

    Upon successful password reset, the server responds with a success message. 
    The user can now log in with their new password.
