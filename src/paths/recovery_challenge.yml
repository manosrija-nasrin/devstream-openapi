  summary: Verifies the recovery challenge code and token from the recovery
    initiation step.
  description: >
    When a user initiates a password recovery, they are sent a unique challenge 
    code (via email, SMS, or another medium) and a signed token in the response. 
    The client must submit this code along with the signed token to confirm 
    their identity.

    Upon successful verification, the server responds with another signed token 
    and its validity period (in seconds) in response. The user can reset their 
    password by submitting the new password along with the signed token within 
    the specified expiration time. 

    If the provided code is invalid, expired, or does not match the expected
    challenge, the server will respond with an appropriate error message.

    The token should be kept secure by client to prevent unauthorized access.
